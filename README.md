NLP Projects and Assignments

## About Me
I am passionate about NLP and have been developing my skills in text preprocessing, ML models, data analysis, web scraping, and metric analysis. I plan to apply my skills to personal projects such as doing more sentiment analysis and continuing to improve my chatbot.

From pre-processing text to creating complex machine learning models, I have been honing my skills to analyze and interpret data. I have also practiced scraping data from websites and calculating tf-idf scores to better understand the relevance of different text elements.

In addition to my technical abilities, I pride myself on my soft skills. Communication, project management, and analytical thinking are all essential qualities that I bring to the table. I am equally comfortable working independently or as part of a team, and I always strive to achieve the best possible outcome. By combining my technical expertise with my strong soft skills, I am confident in my ability to succeed in any data related project. To keep up with this rapidly changing field, I plan to listen to conferences and stay up-to-date with emerging trends. I am interested in employment opportunities in NLP and believe my skills and enthusiasm would be an asset to any team.

## Homework 8 - ChatBot
### Summary
Collaborted with Erik Rodriguez (Tarzerk) to create a chatbot about the video game Elden Ring using Dialogflow, Flask, and NLP techniques such as parsing user input, calculating TF_IDF, and information extracting.

## Homework 4 - N Gram Language Model
### Summary
Collaborted with Erik Rodriguez (Tarzerk) to get all unigrams and bigrams of three language files then calulate the probabilities of each language from every line in the test file.

## Homework 3 - WordNet
### Summary
Use NLTK's WordNet and SentiWordNet package to discover synsets of nouns and verbs and their relations with other words.

## Homework 2 - Word Guessing Game
### Summary
Use NLTK package to do preprocessing and POS tagging on a text file then create a guessing game.

### How to run:
1. Type ‘python3 main.py anat19.txt’ in terminal

## Homework 1 - Text Processing
### Summary
The program takes a CSV file containing each employee’s name, ID, and phone number and reads it in. It then standardizes the data to make sure they all follow the same format. If an ID or phone number needs to be changed, then the user will input a new string until it follows the correct format. After modifying the data, a dictionary is created to contain employee ID as the key and the Person object as value. The program loops through the data and first checks if an ID exists. If not, a new key and value pair is made. The Person object includes first name, last name, middle initial, ID, and phone number as attributes. After all key-value pairs are created, the program saves the dictionary to a pickle file. It then reads and calls each Person’s display() method to output each valid employee’s ID, name, and phone number.

### How to run: 
1. Make sure csv file is inside data folder
2. Type ‘python3 main.py data/data.csv’ in terminal

### Text Processing in Python
Python is good for text processing. It has built in tools to tokenize text as well as normalizing text by using its own regex library. This is important for NLP.

### Takeaway
I’ve learned how to read input files in Python as well as pickling and unpickling a dictionary. I’ve also learned how to use Python’s regex library to find patterns in strings.
